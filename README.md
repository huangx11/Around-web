# Around-web
A Cloud and React-based Social Network

* Built a geo-based social network web application with React JS. 
* Implemented basic token based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT. 
* Implemented features such as "Create Post", "Nearby Posts As Gallery" and "Nearby Posts In Map" with Ant Design, GeoLocation API and Google Map API.
* Built a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (GKE) for better scaling
* Utilized ElasticSearch (GCE) to provide geo-location based search functions such that users can search nearby posts within a distance (e.g. 200km)
* Used Google Vision API to provide a face detection model and integrate with the Go service.
